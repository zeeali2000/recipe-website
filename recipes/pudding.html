        <li>1 1/2 tsp ground ginger </li>

        <li>150g uncrystallised ginger, finely chopped </li>
        <li>Thickened cream or ice cream, to serve </li>
    </ul>
<h4>Ginger sauce</h4>
<ul>
        <li>100g unsalted butter, chopped </li>
        <li>1/3 cup (75g) dark muscovado sugar </li>
        <li>1/3 cup (80ml) ginger beer </li>
        <li>200ml thickened cream </li>
        <li>120g uncrystallised ginger, chopped </li>
       </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Lightly grease a 6-hole Texas muffin pan. </li>    
    <li>Sift the flour, ginger and bicarb into a bowl. Add the sugar, treacle, butter, buttermilk and eggs and whisk until combined. Add the ginger and fold through until well combined. Divide mixture into prepared pan and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden and slightly soft to the touch. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, for the ginger sauce, place all ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. Bring to the boil and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly. </li>
    <li>Turn the puddings out into bowls and pour over the warm ginger sauce. Serve warm with cream or ice cream. </li>
