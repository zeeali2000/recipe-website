    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil spray</li>
        <li>4 bone-in skin-on chicken legs (drumstick and thigh)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>   
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly grease a rimmed baking dish with olive oil. A 9 X 13-inch baking dish should work. </li>
        <li>Place the chicken legs in the prepared baking dish. Generously spray their tops with olive oil and sprinkle them with the seasonings.</li>
        <li>Bake, uncovered, until the skin is crisp and browned and the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, 40-45 minutes. Check the chicken after the first 30 minutes. If the skin or the spices seem to be browning too much, loosely cover it with foil and continue baking. </li>
        <li>Allow the chicken to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
